I have assumed developement of this mod again in place of Ceko 


**MOD Description** 

Fisticuffs is a mod that makes use of the underdeveloped unarmed skill. It adds 6 new tiers of weapons:  

* Wood sprig
* Studded knuckles
* Bronze cestus
* Iron cestus
* Silver cestus
* Black metal cestus  

and one supporting recipe:  

* Iron chain

The long-term goal of the mod is to provide additional armors, consumables, and even animations to support a more visceral brawler-like playthrough.
